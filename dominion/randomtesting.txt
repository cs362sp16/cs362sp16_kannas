Note: This is not late -I got an extention



My random tester was sufficent in testing the code and specifically the adventure and card function we were supposed to test. I had fairly good code coverage in both (in the upper 90's), but it was difficult since both functions were difficult to track. I don't think I explicitly failed to cover any code, but the code coverage indicates I did miss some portions. My unittests had terrible coverage and most of them did not pass. I would say the randomtests were better in this regard. But my unittests did seem to detect a lot more faults. I had a lot of trouble with my process of writing theses tests and making and running them, so there may have been a few problems in that regard.
